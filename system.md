# General Approach

- _1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span>=17+ HCP, can be as few as 14 with a good suit_
- _a pass of 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>= 7 HCP or fewer_
- _we frequently open 4-card majors and may have a longer minor when we do so_

Schenken Big Club combines **two bidding systems**: 

1. a **strong** 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> opening with a unique set of rules and coded responses grounded in the usual High Card Point (HCP) count system, and 

2. other opening bids and responses derived from **Standard American** (and, to some extent, **2/1 Game Force**).

Schenken is grounded primarily in an aggressive hand evaluation system. Opening suit bids other than 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> and responses are based on a combination of HCP and Distribution Points (DP). 

## Hand evaluation by Opener

The opening bidder adds 1 PP for each 4-card suit headed by the Queen or better, an additional point for a 5-card suit, and either 1 or 2 or two points for the 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>... cards _each_, depending on the quality of the suit. (Remember that honours are worth more when combined.) Two distribution points may be added by a suit headed by two of the top three honours with good intermediates. The total point count of a hand is the sum of its HCP and DP and is called Playing Points (PP). (_Caution:_ oftentimes DP are referred to by PP as well.) 

We open almost all hands when the total point count is at least 14. One routine 14-point exception is when opener holds a weak 5-card Club suit, 2 or fewer Diamonds, and no 4-card major&mdash;pass with such a hand.


## Hand evaluation by Responder

Resonder adds 1 PP for a doubleton, 3 for a singleton, and 5 for a void when he has **4-card support for opener's major**. With 3-card support, he adds only 1, 2, and 3 points respectively. Responder requires at least 8 HCP to bid a new suit or Notrump, but may raise their partner's **major** with fewer so long as his hand is worth at least 9 PP with a fit.

A single raise of <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/
<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> shows 9-11 PP, a double raise 12-14. A single raise in <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> is _inverted_, showing at least 11 HCP with 5-card support, _and denies a 4-card major_; a double raise of <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> promises all the same except is 7-10 HCP.

## Points needed for Game

We look for 28, 30, and 32+ points for Game in a major, Game in a minor, and small slam respectively.

**Evaluation for Notrump:** Opener's bid is based upon HCP (15-17), but both Opener and Responder may add PPs as though they were opening, _but only with both a strong suit and sufficient entries_. For example, KQJxxxx with no outside entry across a doubleton is useless unless the Ace falls on the first round of the suit.

Responder invites Game with a _good_ 8 or 9 HCP, and bids Game with 10.

## Just how strong is a 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> opener?

_All 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> openings contain at least 19 PP._ This is why some 17-point hands are opened 1NT, or some 14-point hands are opened 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>; some 17-point hands are too balanced or have high cards in shorter suits, and some 14-point hands you might want to bid and rebid twice in Standard American, even if partner's silent.


## Forcing Openings

1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>

# Notrump Opening Bids

- 1NT: 15-17 HCP, balanced hand

There are 18-point hands we downgrade to 1NT; there are 14-point hands we may upgrade to 1NT (say, with a good 5-card suit, or in third seat). _We frequently open 1NT with a 5-card major._

## Responses to 1NT

- 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Stayman, 
- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> & 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> are Jacoby & Texas transfers to 2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> & 4<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> respectively. 

- We play <a href="https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/4-way-transfers-with-range-ask/">4-way Transfers with Range Ask</a>; 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> is either: 

    - a hand which would invite 3NT, or
    - a transfer to 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>.

    Opener responds to 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> by bidding 2NT if he wouldn't accept an invite to 3NT, 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> if he would. Over 2NT Responder passes with a weak hand or corrects to 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Over 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> he passes if weak with 6+<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, bids 3NT if he meant to invite Game, and 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> to show a strong <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> with shortness in the last bid suit and slam interest.

- 2NT is a transfer to 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, which he may follow up with 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>, or 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> to show shortness and desire for slam as before.

- 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Puppet Stayman, asking Opener for a 5-card major.

- 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> shows at least 5-5 in the minors and is forcing.

- 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> show
    
    - 11+ HCP, 
    - 1- cards in the bid suit, and 
    - 3- cards in the other major.

    Opener can bid 3NT with a stopper in the short major, bid the other major (showing 5 in the suit), or bid his best minor at the 4-level. Recall that, as noted in 4-way transfers, with a 6-card minor, no 4-card major, and a short suit, Responder starts with 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> or 2NT then bids his shortness.
 
 ## Bidding hands with Game values and 6-4 in the majors

 Start with Stayman. If partner responds 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, make a Texas transfer to your 6-card major.

 ## Bidding hands with slam invitational values and 6-4 in the majors

 Start with Stayman, then jump to 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Partner must bid 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, then you bid your 6-card major. 4NT is a 1430 keycard ask in that suit. 

_Recall: Key cards include the four Aces and the King of agreed (or implied) suit. Responses to 1430 keycard 4NT are:_

- _5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 1 or 4 keycards_
- _5<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 3 or 0 keycards_
- _5<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> 2 (or 5) keycards _without_ the Queen of trumps_
- _5<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> 2 (or 5) keycards _with_ the Queen of trumps_

## Rebids after Opener answers 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> Stayman

- We adopt the <a href="https://www.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/536">Smolen</a> convention at the 3-level for when the auction goes 1NT, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 

  - 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> shows 5-4 in <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> and <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 
  - 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> shows 5-4 in <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> and <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>,
  - both are forcing to Game.

With such a holding in the majors but only invitational values, simply bid your major after Opener responds 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> to your Stayman&mdash;though an invitational hand with <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> can also be shown this way when Opener has shown 4 <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>s. With even fewer points, simply Jacoby transfer to your major.

To be clearer, we take the following from Gavin Wolpert: 

<p style="text-align: center;">
"I think most experts just play 1NT-2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2X-2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> as any 5-card spade invite, since you get so much value in playing in 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> rather than 2NT when partner declines. The expert standard approach these days is to play that all hands with 5 spades and an invite start by bidding Stayman, regardless of whether they have 4 Hearts.
After 1NT-2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> is invitational with 5 Spades.
Then opener does the following:
2NT = I accept your invitation but I only have a doubleton spade (this gives room for responder to retreat to 3 of a minor when they have a weakish 5-5 invite); 
3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> = I have a fit and a decent hand;
3NT = I have a fit and would be interested in playing 3NT when you are 5-3-3-2;
4<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> = I accept your invite and want to play 4<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>.
There is so much value in stopping in 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> when you have a 5-2 spade fit and are not going to Game. 2NT sucks!
May 31, 2023"</p>

- Impossible Major at the 3-level.

When Opener answers Stayman with a 4-card major, Responder bids 3 of the other major to show a fit with Opener and interest in slam. 

- Corollary: 1NT, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, **4NT** is a quantitative invite to 6NT, not a keycard ask. <a href="https://www.nxtbook.com/acbl/bridgebulletin/2022_04/index.php#/p/64">Bridge Bulletin - Consults with the Doctor - The many faces of 4NT (requires subscription/ACBL login)</a>.

## Dealing with Direct Interference

We play "<a href="https://www.larryco.com/bridge-articles/lebensohl-stolen-bid-doubles-and-interference-over-1nt">Berkowitz</a>" when the opponents make a direct overcall of our 1NT. All systems are on over Double or 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>; 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and Double would mean Stayman respectively.

If Overcaller says 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or higher:

- 2X is weak and to play, 
- 2NT is natural but doesn't promise a stopper, 
- Double is takeout for the other suits, and
- a cue bid is Game-forcing Stayman,

however, Texas transfers still apply.


### A note on Superaccepts

After a 2-level Jacoby Transfer, Opener may show his liking for Responder's suit with the following: 

- 2NT: Balanced maximum with 3-card support

- 3 of Responder's major: maximum with 4-card support

## Other Notrump Opening Bids

- 2NT: 5-5 or better in the minors, 11-16 HCP. 

  - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> is 1430 for the suit bid; 5 of the other minor is the _specific King ask._

- 3NT: "Gambling," solid 7-card <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> suit

  - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> asks Opener to bid his suit


# Major Suit Openings 

Opening bids at the 1-level (except 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and 1NT) limit the hand to 11-16 HCP. We frequently open 4-card majors in all seats **and may have a longer minor when we do so.** When you have a choice between opening 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or 1 of a major, **give preference to a lead-directing bid;** we do not open a 4-card major just because we have one&mdash;1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> invites partner to lead that suit if we lose the auction _and_ to upgrade his hand if he holds one of the top three honours in the suit. 

One exception to the lead-directing opening bid is when one holds a 5-card <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> suit and a good 4-card <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> suit; open 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> so as to minimize rebid problems.

  ## Responses to 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>

  - 1NT: 8-10 HCP balanced or 7 HCP with stiff or void in Opener's suit

  - Single raise: 9-11 PP

  - 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 5+ <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 11+ HCP or distributional 10+ 

  - Double raise: 12-14 PP

  - 2NT: 11-12 HCP balanced

  - 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: **by an unpassed hand** is a our Game-forcing raise, showing 4-card support or better together with at least 16 PP. _3NT is not an option_, we will always play in at least 4 of our major. Priority for Opener is to show shortness, then to show whether he's maximum or minimum. These agreements are on through 5<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> should Opponent(s) interfere:

    - 3 of non-fit suit: 1- cards in that suit
    - 3 of agreed major: maximum values, no shortness
    - 3NT: minimum values, no shortness
    - A rebid of 3 of agreed suit or 3NT by Responder is _temporizing;_ Opener is asked to start cue bidding his lowest first-round control.

  - 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: **Strong Jump Shift**, see <a href="https://www.kwbridge.com/bb/b_jshift.htm">this </a> article for more details. 6+<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> with 2/3 top honours and 17+HCP. Opener's first obligation is to bid 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> with a doubleton Ace, King, or Queen. His next priority is to rebid his suit if he opened with at least 5 cards, next a side four-card suit.
    - 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: doubleton A,K, or Q.
    - 3 of opened suit: 5+ cards
    - 3 of other major or 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 4+ cards in bid suit.
      - any suit: shortness and a fit with Opener 

  3NT: 13-15 HCP balanced
  
  _Note: with 3-card support for Opener and shortness somewhere, even a doubleton, we prefer to show support rather than bid NT; 4333 shape is an exception_.

### Two-Way Reverse Drury

When Opener says 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> in 3<sup>rd</sup> seat and 4<sup>th</sup> chair passes, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is invitational (12-14 PP) with 3-card support, and 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> is invitational with 4-card support.

This is to say, 4<sup>th</sup> chair openings are sound, only 3<sup>rd</sup> chair openings can be a little light.

### After Overcall

If unpassed:
  - Simple raise: 9-11 PP
  - Cue bid: Game-forcing raise (as 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>)
  - Double raise: 12-14 PP

If passed: 
  - Simple raise: 9-11 PP
  - Cue bid: 12-14 PP
  - Double raise: 5+ cards, 8-PP


### After a Takeout Double

If unpassed:
  - 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (jump cue in other major): forcing raise
  - 2NT: invitational (12-14 PP) with 4-card support
  - 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (cue bid of other major): invitational with 3-card support with a doubleton or stiff (remember that Redouble is an option; this kind of raise shows a ruffing value)
  - 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 8-10 HCP, good 5+card suit, 3-card support for Opener
  - simple raise: 9-11 PP, 3- or 4-card support
  - jump raise: preemptive
  - Redouble: 10+ HCP, implies no fit, interest in penalty double

If passed:
  - 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (jump cue in other major): invitational with 4-card support
  - 2NT: Unusual for the minors with only 8-10 points
  -  1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (cue bid of other major): invitational with 3-card support
  - simple raise: 9-11 PP
  - jump raise: preemptive

  ## Special rebid by Opener

  Suppose the auction goes 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-1M:

  - 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: game-forcing raise of Responder's major.

  Opener is usually showing a good <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> suit or an Ace-rich hand which reevealuates after the 1M bid to at least 18 PP. Think of Opener saying with this bid, "Partner, your response makes my hand a 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> opener."

  Responder bids the same way Opener does in a 1M-3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> auction.

# Minor Suit Openings

As mentioned in the introductory comments, the rules for responses to 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> are very different. We start with 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Recall that this bid shows 17+HCP, sometimes 14+, but *always* 19+PP.

## Responses to 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>

  - 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 0-6 HCP. Can pass any non-jump rebid by Opener; can raise or bid own suit with 4-6 HCP if passing a non-jump rebid is undesirable (e.g. Opener rebids a simple 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> but you're void and have 5 Spades with 4-6 HCP; bid 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>).
  
  _However_, if Responder's hand reevaluates to 9+PP after Opener's rebid, jump to game in his suit.

  - 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 7-8 HCP, at least one Ace or King (with 7-8 points in Quacks, bid 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>). Forcing to game _most of the time_ (e.g. definitely forcing when Opener rebids 2NT).

  **All other responses are game-forcing**
  - 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 5+ cards, 9+ HCP

Opener should not raise Responder's suit immediately if he has his own 5+card suit, but raise if Responder himself doesn't. An immediate raise of Responder's suit implies 4+ card support. 

Responder should bid naturally, *patterning out* his hand; a NT rebid by responder shows 5332 shape.

  - 1NT: 9-11 HCP, balanced
  - 2NT: 12-14 HCP, balanced
    - 2/3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>:  Stayman; Impossible Major applies
    - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>: 1430 for that suit
    - 4NT: quantitative invite to 6NT
    - other bids by Opener are natural
  - 3NT: 15+ HCP balanced
    - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Stayman; Impossible Major
    - 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 1430 for that suit
    - 4NT: quantitative invite to 6NT
  
### Special note on 1430/quantitative raise auctions

**Bidding 5NT in a 1430 auction promises all key cards and the Queen of trumps are accounted for.** It asks partner to show his lowest unbid King. Subsequent bids below the agreed suit ask partner to bid another King, if he has one. 

If the Queen Ask receives a response at the 6-level, showing the Queen and the King of the suit bid, the cheapest response below the agreed suit asks partner if he has anything more (e.g. assuming <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> are trump, ...4NT-5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-5<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-6<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-6<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> asks for the King of either <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>.)

When 4NT is a quantitative raise, 

  - 5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 4-card suit, inviting small slam if partner has 4-card support; otherwise correct to 5NT
  - 6<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 5-card suit, invites partner to pass with support or to correct to 6NT.

  ### Jump responses to 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>

  A single jump (except 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, which is 9+HCP, 5+<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>) shows 9+ HCP and a *solid* 6+ card suit. AKQJx is admissable, but Responder should have 6 tricks. 

  A double jump shows 11+ HCP with a long but *broken* suit (missing 1 of the 4 top honours). Again, Responder should have a 6+ card suit so that if Opener happens to have the missing honour, he can consider the suit solid and count tricks.

## Rebids by Opener

### Non-jump rebids

After 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> by Responder, **all** non-jump rebids **except 2NT** are non-forcing. Recall that Responder *can* bid again if he's maximum and his hand either fits very poorly but has own suit, or fits very well, in which case he bids game.

Unless Opener is balanced, he bids his 5-card suit, then his 4-card suit, then his 3-card suit. In general, each partner prioritizes *patterning out* his hand.

Suppose Opener is balanced: 

1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>*: 
  - 1NT: 18-20 HCP
  - 2NT: 21-22 HCP
    - Stayman and transfers apply since 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>* is artificial

That is, **if Responder makes a positive response, systems are off**&mdash;even if Opener has a NT rebid. Both players bid naturally in a game-forcing auction.

### Jump Rebids


#### After a 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> response

A very good hand, generally 23+ PP with a good 6+ card suit. **It is forcing,** and partner's priority is to show a fit or a doubleton honour by raising, simply with 0-3 HCP, jumping with 4-6. *With no fit*, Responder simply shows a source of strength or a suit. 

#### After a positive response

Same as Responder's jump bids: single jump shows a solid suit, double jump shows a broken suit.


## Dealing with Interference

### At the 1-level

  - Pass: 0-6 HCP (note this is alertable)
  - 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 7-8 HCP, at least an Ace or a King
  - 1NT: 7-8 HCP with stopper in Opponent's suit
  - any other (non-jump) free bid: 4-6 HCP with a good 5+ card suit
  - Double: 9+ HCP
  - Cue bid: 9+ HCP and shortness in Opponent's suit
  
### At the 2-level

  - Pass: 0-8 HCP
  - Double: 9+ HCP
  - Free (suit) bid: 6-8 HCP with a good suit
  - 2NT: 7-8 HCP with 1+ stopper in Overcaller's suit

### At the 3-level

  - Pass: 0-8 HCP
  - Double: 9+ through 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, penalty-oriented otherwise
  - Free (suit) bid: 7-8 HCP, good suit
  - 3NT: 8-9 HCP, 1+ stopper

### Schenkensohl

A modification of the Lebensohl convention, Schenkensohl is available to Responder in the following auctions: 

  - 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-Pass-Pass-Double
  - 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>-Pass-Pass-Double
  - 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>-Pass-Pass-Double

In many situations&mdash;if not most&mdash;Opener will either bid his own suit or some level of Notrump. However, he may have a hand he deems worthy of a reopening Double. How should we respond? We need a way to tell partner whether we are at the lower end of our range (0-5 (bad)) or the higher ((good) 5-8)&mdash;hence borrowing from Lebensohl.

  - 3-level bid: 6-8 HCP, **good hand**,  4+cards in the suit bid
  - 2NT: relay, **weak hand**; Opener **must** bid 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, Responder passes or bids his 4+card suit
  - 2NT then 3NT: 6-8 HCP, **exactly 1 full stopper**, no 4-card major
  - 3NT: 6-8 HCP, **no stopper**, no 4-card major
  - 3-level cuebid: 6-8 HCP, **partial stopper**, no 4-card major
  - 2NT-then-3-level-cuebid: 6-8 HCP, partial stopper, **4 of the other major if Overcaller bid one**. 

### Responsive Double by Responder through 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> after 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> Opening

  Suppose the auction goes such that Partner opens 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, you either bid 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or Pass to show 0-6 HCP, and Opponent(s) bid(s) such that Opener must bid at the 3-level to show his suit&mdash;and he does, say, 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>. RHO bids 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> and you have a maximum (4-6 HCP) hand and 4-4 or better in the minor suits. 

  Double RHO's bid. This is a "Responsive" Double. Whereas we normally play standard Responsive Doubles through 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>, but when you or Partner opens 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, we play this Double through 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>.



## The 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> Opening

Shows 3+<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> and 11-16 HCP. Note that if we have 15-16 HCP then we are unbalanced, since we would prefer to open 1NT. We also prefer to open a good 4-card minor over 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, since it takes more bidding room from the Opponents and is lead-directing.

With a weak 5-card <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> suit and 3 <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>s, we open 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> and immediately rebid 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> (or 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> if Responder makes an Inverted <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> raise). This will become more clear after the section on opening 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>.

## Responses to 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>

**Remember:** Responder needs 8+ HCP to bid a new suit at the 1-level or 1NT.

- 1M:     8+ HCP, 4+ cards in the major bid.
- 1NT:    8-10 HCP balanced (might be 7-10 if holding 1-<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>)
- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>:   **by an unpassed hand** is "Inverted": 5+<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 11+ HCP, denies 4-card major. A cue bid also shows 11+ HCP and a <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> fit. The Inverted 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> raise is **off if a passed hand or Opponents interfere.** 
- 2M:     Weak Jump Shift; 7- HCP and a good 6-card suit
- 2NT:    11-12 HCP balanced, may have 4-card major.
  - Opener may bid his own 4-card major at the 3-level, inviting Game in that major or forcing to 3NT.
- 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>:   Constructive, showing 5+<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, normally 8-10 HCP (but can be 7 with good shape and no wasted HCP). Denies a 4-card major, usually unbalanced.
- 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>:   Strong Jump Shift. Here's <a href="https://www.kwbridge.com/bb/b_jshift.htm">this </a> article again.
- 3NT:    13-15 HCP balanced, may have a 4-card major

## The Inverted <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> Auction

After 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, we prioritize finding 3NT:

- 2M:     (by Opener) shows a stopper in the major bid
- 2NT:    stoppers in both majors
- 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>:   Opened with a <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> suit not worth opening. Does not deny stoppers in other suits. Responder must reevaluate his hand to consider passing, bidding 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> to play, showing a major suit stopper, or bidding 3NT.

### Fourth Suit Forcing (in an Inverted <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> Auction)

Shows a **partial stopper** in the fourth suit. For example, 

- 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 2NT, 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>

shows a partial stopper in <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Opener may retreat to 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or bid 3NT with at least a partial <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> stopper himself.

#### "One not, two got"

If there is **one** danger suit&mdash;e.g. 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-Pass-2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>, in which case <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> is the only danger suit&mdash;a Cue Bid of the Opponent's suit **denies** a stopper and asks Partner to bid 3NT with a full one.

If there are **two** danger suits, bidding one **shows** a stopper in it. Again, bidding the fourth suit shows a **partial** only.

#### Special bid

If the Opponents overcall 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> with 1NT, Responder plays Cappelletti:

- Double: Penalty
- 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>:   One-suited hand
- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>:   Both majors (4-4 or better)
- 2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>:   <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> and a minor (4+M-5m)
- 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>:   <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> and a minor (4+M-5m)
- 2NT:    5-5 or better in the minors

#### The SOS Redouble

Suppose the Auction goes 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-Double-Pass-Pass to you. Rightie has a stack of Diamonds. Opener Redoubles to ask Partner to bid his best major; Partner passes with 4+<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>.

## The 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> Opening

Shows 11-16 HCP and normally 6+<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, but could show a very good 5-card <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> suit. We do not normally open 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> with a 5-card suit and a minimum hand if vulnerable or Partner is a passed hand&mdash;even if the hand is worth 14 PP.


## Responses to 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>

- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: forcing; has a 4-card major; asks Opener for one (like Stayman)
  - 2NT: no 4-card major; extra values in the unbid suits
    - 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span><span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>: 12+ HCP; **forcing**
  - 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: total minimum
- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> followed by 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 6+<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 1-<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, 8-11 HCP
- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> followed by 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 1430 for <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>; Queen Ask applies; 5<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> asks for specific Kings
- 2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>: 5+ card suit, 8-11 HCP
- 2NT: 11-12 HCP balanced
- 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>: 12+ HCP, 5+ cards; forcing
  - Opener should raise with 3+ card support, but can opt for 3NT or retreat to 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>
  - If Responder's bid were 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, Opener should bid a major suit stopper if he has only one
- 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: to play
- 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: invitational to 5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>

## Dealing with Interference at the 2-Level

### Direct Overcall

We use negative doubles through 4<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>. If Overcaller bid 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, Double conveys "stolen bid" and Opener responds as above. 

### Takeout Double

Redouble with 10+ HCP, bid a (natural) suit with fewer. If Advancer then bids a suit, Opener bids: 

- Double: 4+ cards in Advancer's suit
- Another suit: 4+ cards in bid suit
- Pass: forcing; we have the majority of the points

### 4th-seat Overcaller

Auction goes 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-Pass-2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-2M.

- Double: penalty; suggests 4 of Overcaller's suit
- Pass: forcing; 4 of the unbid major
- 2NT: 1+ stopper
- 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>
- 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: denies other options
