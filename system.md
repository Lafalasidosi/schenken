# General Approach

- _1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span>=17+ HCP, can be as few as 14 with a good suit_
- _a pass of 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>= 7 HCP or fewer_
- _we frequently open 4-card majors and may have a longer minor when we do so_

Schenken Big Club combines **two bidding systems**: 

1. a **strong** 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> opening with a unique set of rules and coded responses grounded in the usual High Card Point (HCP) count system, and 

2. other opening bids and responses derived from **Standard American** (and, to some extent, **2/1 Game Force**).

Schenken is grounded primarily in an aggressive hand evaluation system. Opening suit bids other than 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> and responses are based on a combination of HCP and Distribution Points (DP). 

## Hand evaluation by Opener

The opening bidder adds 1 PP for each 4-card suit headed by the Queen or better, an additional point for a 5-card suit, and either 1 or 2 or two points for the 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>... cards _each_, depending on the quality of the suit. (Remember that honours are worth more when combined.) Two distribution points may be added by a suit headed by two of the top three honours with good intermediates. The total point count of a hand is the sum of its HCP and DP and is called Playing Points (PP). (_Caution:_ oftentimes DP are referred to by PP as well.) 

We open almost all hands when the total point count is at least 14. One routine 14-point exception is when opener holds a weak 5-card Club suit, 2 or fewer Diamonds, and no 4-card major&mdash;pass with such a hand.


## Hand evaluation by Responder

Resonder adds 1 PP for a doubleton, 3 for a singleton, and 5 for a void when he has **4-card support for opener's major**. With 3-card support, he adds only 1, 2, and 3 points respectively. Responder requires at least 8 HCP to bid a new suit or Notrump, but may raise their partner's **major** with fewer so long as his hand is worth at least 9 PP with a fit.

A single raise of <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/
<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> shows 9-11 PP, a double raise 12-14. A single raise in <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> is _inverted_, showing at least 11 HCP with 5-card support, _and denies a 4-card major_; a double raise of <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> promises all the same except is 7-10 HCP.

## Points needed for Game

Following a non-1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>opening, we look for 28, 30, and 32+ points for Game in a major, Game in a minor, and small slam respectively.

**Evaluation for Notrump:** Opener's bid is based upon HCP (15-17), but both Opener and Responder may add PPs as though they were opening, _but only with both a strong suit and sufficient entries_. For example, KQJxxxx with no outside entry across a doubleton is useless unless the Ace falls on the first round of the suit.

Responder invites Game with a _good_ 8 or 9 HCP, and bids Game with 10.

## Just how strong is a 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> opener?

_All 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> openings contain at least 19 PP._ This is why some 17-point hands are opened 1NT, or some 14-point hands are opened 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>; some 17-point hands are too balanced or have high cards in shorter suits, and some 14-point hands you might want to bid and rebid twice in Standard American, even if partner's silent.


## Forcing Openings

1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>

# Notrump Opening Bids

- 1NT: 15-17 HCP, balanced hand

There are 18-point hands we downgrade to 1NT; there are 14-point hands we may upgrade to 1NT (say, with a good 5-card suit, or in third seat). _We frequently open 1NT with a 5-card major._

## Responses to 1NT

- 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Stayman, 
- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> & 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> are Jacoby & Texas transfers to 2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> & 4<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> respectively. 

- We play <a href="https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/4-way-transfers-with-range-ask/">4-way Transfers with Range Ask</a>; 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> is either: 

    - a hand which would invite 3NT, or
    - a transfer to 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>.

    Opener responds to 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> by bidding 2NT if he wouldn't accept an invite to 3NT, 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> if he would. Over 2NT Responder passes with a weak hand or corrects to 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Over 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> he passes if weak with 6+<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, bids 3NT if he meant to invite Game, and 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> to show a strong <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> with shortness in the last bid suit and slam interest.

- 2NT is a transfer to 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, which he may follow up with 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>, or 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> to show shortness and desire for slam as before.

- 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Puppet Stayman, asking Opener for a 5-card major.

- 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> shows at least 5-5 in the minors and is forcing.

- 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> show
    
    - 11+ HCP, 
    - 1- cards in the bid suit, and 
    - 3- cards in the other major.

    Opener can bid 3NT with a stopper in the short major, bid the other major (showing 5 in the suit), or bid his best minor at the 4-level. Recall that, as noted in 4-way transfers, with a 6-card minor, no 4-card major, and a short suit, Responder starts with 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> or 2NT then bids his shortness.
 
 ## Bidding hands with Game values and 6-4 in the majors

 Start with Stayman. If partner responds 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, make a Texas transfer to your 6-card major.

 ## Bidding hands with slam invitational values and 6-4 in the majors

 Start with Stayman, then jump to 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Partner must bid 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, then you bid your 6-card major. 4NT is a 1430 keycard ask in that suit. 

_Recall: Keycards include the four Aces and the King of agreed (or implied) suit. Responses to 1430 keycard 4NT are:_

- _5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 1 or 4 keycards_
- _5<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 3 or 0 keycards_
- _5<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> 2 (or 5) keycards _without_ the Queen of trumps_
- _5<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> 2 (or 5) keycards _with_ the Queen of trumps_

## Rebids after Opener answers 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> Stayman

- We adopt the <a href="https://www.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/536">Smolen</a> convention at the 3-level for when the auction goes 1NT, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 

  - 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> shows 5-4 in <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> and <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 
  - 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> shows 5-4 in <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> and <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>,
  - both are forcing to Game.

With such a holding in the majors but only invitational values, simply bid your major after Opener responds 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> to your Stayman&mdash;though an invitational hand with <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> can also be shown this way when Opener has shown 4 <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>s. With even fewer points, simply Jacoby transfer to your major.

To be clearer, we take the following from Gavin Wolpert: 

<p style="text-align: center;">
"I think most experts just play 1NT-2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2X-2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> as any 5-card spade invite, since you get so much value in playing in 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> rather than 2NT when partner declines. The expert standard approach these days is to play that all hands with 5 spades and an invite start by bidding Stayman, regardless of whether they have 4 Hearts.
After 1NT-2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> is invitational with 5 Spades.
Then opener does the following:
2NT = I accept your invitation but I only have a doubleton spade (this gives room for responder to retreat to 3 of a minor when they have a weakish 5-5 invite); 
3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> = I have a fit and a decent hand;
3NT = I have a fit and would be interested in playing 3NT when you are 5-3-3-2;
4<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> = I accept your invite and want to play 4<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>.
There is so much value in stopping in 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> when you have a 5-2 spade fit and are not going to Game. 2NT sucks!
May 31, 2023"</p>

- Impossible Major at the 3-level.

When Opener answers Stayman with a 4-card major, Responder bids 3 of the other major to show a fit with Opener and interest in slam. 

- Corollary: 1NT, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, **4NT** is a quantitative invite to 6NT, not a keycard ask. <a href="https://www.nxtbook.com/acbl/bridgebulletin/2022_04/index.php#/p/64">Bridge Bulletin - Consults with the Doctor - The many faces of 4NT (requires subscription/ACBL login)</a>.

## Dealing with Direct Interference

We play "<a href="https://www.larryco.com/bridge-articles/lebensohl-stolen-bid-doubles-and-interference-over-1nt">Berkowitz</a>" when the opponents make a direct overcall of our 1NT. All systems are on over Double or 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>; 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and Double would mean Stayman respectively.

If Overcaller says 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or higher:

- 2X is weak and to play, 
- 2NT is natural but doesn't promise a stopper, 
- Double is takeout for the other suits, and
- a cue bid is Game-forcing Stayman,

however, Texas transfers still apply.


### A note on Superaccepts

After a 2-level Jacoby Transfer, Opener may show his liking for Responder's suit with the following: 

- 2NT: Balanced maximum with 3-card support

- 3 of Responder's major: maximum with 4-card support

## Other Notrump Opening Bids

- 2NT: 5-5 or better in the minors, 11-16 HCP. 

  - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> is 1430 for the suit bid; 5 of the other minor is the _specific King ask._

- 3NT: "Gambling," solid 7-card <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> suit

  - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> asks Opener to bid his suit


# Major Suit Openings 

We frequently open 4-card majors in all seats **and may have a longer minor when we do so.** When you have a choice between opening 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or 1 of a major, **give preference to a lead-directing bid;** we do not open a 4-card major just because we have one&mdash;1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> invites partner to lead that suit if we lose the auction _and_ to upgrade his hand if he holds one of the top three honours in the suit. 

One exception to the lead-directing opening bid is when one holds a 5-card <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> suit and a good 4-card <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> suit; open 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> so as to minimize rebid problems.

  ## Responses to 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>

  - 1NT: 8-10 HCP balanced or 7 HCP with stiff or void in Opener's suit

  - Single raise: 9-11 PP

  - 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 5+ <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 11+ HCP or distributional 10+ 

  - Double raise: 12-14 PP

  - 2NT: 11-12 HCP balanced

  - 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: **by an unpassed hand** is a our Game-forcing raise, showing 4-card support or better together with at least 16 PP. _3NT is not an option_, we will always play in at least 4 of our major. Priority for Opener is to show shortness, then to show whether he's maximum or minimum. These agreements are on through 5<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> should Opponent(s) interfere:

    - 3 of non-fit suit: 1- cards in that suit
    - 3 of agreed major: maximum values, no shortness
    - 3NT: minimum values, no shortness
    - A rebid of 3 of agreed suit or 3NT by Responder is _temporizing;_ Opener is asked to start cue bidding his lowest first-round control.

  - 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: **Strong Jump Shift**, see <a href="https://www.kwbridge.com/bb/b_jshift.htm">this </a> article for more details. 6+<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> with 2/3 top honours and 17+HCP. Opener's first obligation is to bid 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> with a doubleton Ace, King, or Queen. His next priority is to rebid his suit if he opened with at least 5 cards, next a side four-card suit.
    - 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: doubleton A,K, or Q.
    - 3 of opened suit: 5+ cards
    - 3 of other major or 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 4+ cards in bid suit.
      - any suit: shortness and a fit with Opener 

  3NT: 13-15 HCP balanced
  
  _Note: with 3-card support for Opener and shortness somewhere, even a doubleton, we prefer to show support rather than bid NT; 4333 shape is an exception_.

### Two-Way Reverse Drury

When Opener says 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> in 3<sup>rd</sup> seat and 4<sup>th</sup> chair passes, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is invitational (12-14 PP) with 3-card support, and 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> is invitational with 4-card support.

This is to say, 4<sup>th</sup> chair openings are sound, only 3<sup>rd</sup> chair openings can be a little light.

### After Overcall

If unpassed:
  - Simple raise: 9-11 PP
  - Cue bid: Game-forcing raise (as 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>)
  - Double raise: 12-14 PP

If passed: 
  - Simple raise: 9-11 PP
  - Cue bid: 12-14 PP
  - Double raise: 5+ cards, 8-PP


### After a Takeout Double

If unpassed:
  - 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (jump cue in other major): forcing raise
  - 2NT: invitational (12-14 PP) with 4-card support
  - 1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (cue bid of other major): invitational with 3-card support with a doubleton or stiff (remember that Redouble is an option; this kind of raise shows a ruffing value)
  - 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 8-10 HCP, good 5+card suit, 3-card support for Opener
  - simple raise: 9-11 PP, 3- or 4-card support
  - jump raise: preemptive
  - Redouble: 10+ HCP, implies no fit, interest in penalty double

If passed:
  - 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (jump cue in other major): invitational with 4-card support
  - 2NT: Unusual for the minors with only 8-10 points
  -  1<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> (cue bid of other major): invitational with 3-card support
  - simple raise: 9-11 PP
  - jump raise: preemptive

  ## Special rebid by Opener

  Suppose the auction goes 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-1M:

  - 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: game-forcing raise of Responder's major.

  Opener is usually showing a good <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> suit or an Ace-rich hand which reevealuates after the 1M bid to at least 18 PP. Think of Opener saying with this bid, "Partner, your response makes my hand a 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> opener."

  Responder bids the same way Opener does in a 1M-3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> auction.

# Minor Suit Openings

As mentioned in the introductory comments, the rules for responses to 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> are very different. We start with 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Recall that this bid shows 17+HCP, sometimes 14+, but *always* 19+PP.

## Responses to 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>

  - 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 0-6 HCP. Can pass any non-jump rebid by Opener; can raise or bid own suit with 4-6 HCP if passing a non-jump rebid is undesirable (e.g. Opener rebids a simple 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> but you're void and have 5 Spades with 4-6 HCP; bid 1S).
  
  _However_, if Responder's hand reevaluates to 9+PP after Opener's rebid, jump to game in his suit.

  - 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 7-8 HCP, at least one Ace or King (with 7-8 points in Quacks, bid 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>). Forcing to game _most of the time_ (e.g. definitely forcing when Opener rebids 2NT).

  **All other responses are game-forcing**
  - 1<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 5+ cards, 9+ HCP

Opener should not raise Responder's suit immediately if he has his own 5+card suit, but raise if Responder himself doesn't. An immediate raise of Responder's suit implies 4+ card support. 

Responder should bid naturally, *patterning out* his hand; a NT rebid by responder shows 5332 shape.

  - 1NT: 9-11 HCP, balanced
  - 2NT: 12-14 HCP, balanced
    - 2/3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>:  Stayman; Impossible Major applies
    - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>: 1430 for that suit
    - 4NT: quantitative invite to 6NT
    - other bids by Opener are natural
  - 3NT: 15+ HCP balanced
    - 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Stayman; Impossible Major
    - 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 1430 for that suit
    - 4NT: quantitative invite to 6NT
  
### Special note on 1430/quantitative raise auctions

**Bidding 5NT in a 1430 auction promises all key cards and the Queen of trumps are accounted for.** It asks partner to show his lowest unbid King. Subsequent bids below the agreed suit ask partner to bid another King, if he has one. 

If the Queen Ask receives a response at the 6-level, showing the Queen and the King of the suit bid, the cheapest response below the agreed suit asks partner if he has anything more (e.g. ...4NT-5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-5<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>-6<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-6<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> asks for the King of either <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>.)

When 4NT is a quantitative raise, 

  - 5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 4-card suit, inviting small slam if partner has 4-card support; otherwise correct to 5NT
  - 6<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 5-card suit, invites partner to pass with support or to correct to 6NT.

  ### Jump responses to 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>

  A single jump (except 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, which is 9+HCP, 5+<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>) shows 9+ HCP and a *solid* 6+ card suit. AKQJx is admissable, but Responder should have 6 tricks. 

  A double jump shows 11+ HCP with a long but *broken* suit (missing 1 of the 4 top honours). Again, Responder should have a 6+ card suit so that if Opener happens to have the missing honour, he can consider the suit solid and count tricks.

## Rebids by Opener

**Non-jump rebids (with the exception of 2NT) are non-forcing when Responder bid 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>.**

Unless Opener is balanced, he bids his 5-card suit, then his 4-card suit, then his 3-card suit. In general, each partner prioritizes *patterning out* his hand.
