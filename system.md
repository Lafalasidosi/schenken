# General Approach

- _1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span>=17+ HCP, can be as few as 14 with a good suit_
- _a pass of 1<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>= 7 HCP or fewer_
- _we frequently open 4-card majors and may have a longer minor when we do so_

Schenken Big Club combines **two bidding systems**: 

1. a **strong** 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> opening with a unique set of rules and coded responses grounded in the usual High Card Point (HCP) count system, and 

2. other opening bids and responses derived from **Standard American** (and, to some extent, **2/1 Game Force**).

Schenken is grounded primarily in an aggressive hand evaluation system. Opening suit bids other than 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> and responses are based on a combination of HCP and Playing Points (PP).

## Hand evaluation by Opener

The opening bidder adds 1 PP for each 4-card suit headed by the Queen or better, an additional point for a 5-card suit, and either 1 or 2 or two points for the 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>... cards _each_, depending on the quality of the suit. (Remember that honours are worth more when combined.) Two playing points may be added by a suit headed by two of the top three honours with good intermediates. The total point count of a hand is the sum of its HCP and PP. 

We open almost all hands when the total point count is at least 14. One routine 14-point exception is when opener holds a weak 5-card Club suit, 2 or fewer Diamonds, and no 4-card major&mdash;pass with such a hand.


## Hand evaluation by Responder

Resonder adds 1 PP for a doubleton, 3 for a singleton, and 5 for a void when he has **4-card support for opener's major**. With 3-card support, he adds only 1, 2, and 3 points respectively. Responder requires at least 8 HCP to bid a new suit or Notrump, but may raise their partner's **major** with fewer so long as his hand is worth at least 9 PP with a fit.

A single raise of <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>/
<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> shows 9-11 PP, a double raise 12-14. A single raise in <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> is _inverted_, showing at least 11 HCP with 5-card support, _and denies a 4-card major_; a double raise of <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> promises all the same except is 7-10 HCP.

## Points needed for Game

Following a non-1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>opening, we look for 28, 30, and 32+ points for Game in a major, Game in a minor, and small slam respectively.

**Evaluation for Notrump:** Opener's bid is based upon HCP (15-17), but both Opener and Responder may add PPs as though they were opening, _but only with both a strong suit and sufficient entries_. For example, KQJxxxx with no outside entry across a doubleton is useless unless the Ace falls on the first round of the suit.

Responder invites Game with a _good_ 8 or 9 HCP, and bids Game with 10.

## Just how strong is a 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> opener?

_All 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> openings contain at least 19 PP._ This is why some 17-point hands are opened 1NT, or some 14-point hands are opened 1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>; some 17-point hands are too balanced or have high cards in shorter suits, and some 14-point hands you might want to bid and rebid twice in Standard American, even if partner's silent.


## Forcing Openings

1<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>

## Notrump Opening Bids

- 1NT: 15-17 HCP, balanced hand

There are 18-point hands we downgrade to 1NT; there are 14-point hands we may upgrade to 1NT (say, with a good 5-card suit, or in third seat). _We frequently open 1NT with a 5-card major._

### Responses to 1NT

- 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Stayman, 
- 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> & 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> are Jacoby & Texas transfers to 2<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> & 4<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> respectively. 

- We play <a href="https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/4-way-transfers-with-range-ask/">4-way Transfers with Range Ask</a>; 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> is either: 

    - a hand which would invite 3NT, or
    - a transfer to 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>.

    Opener responds to 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> by bidding 2NT if he wouldn't accept an invite to 3NT, 3c/c if he would. Responder passes with a weak hand&mdash;he had a weak hand with 6+<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> after all&mdash;bids 3NT if he meant to invite Game, and 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>/<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> to indicate shortness in the bid suit and slam interest.

- 2NT, he may follow up with 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>, or 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> to show shortness and desire for slam.

- 3<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> is Puppet Stayman, asking Opener for a 5-card major.

- 3<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> shows at least 5-5 in the minors and is forcing.

- 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> or 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> show
    
    - 11+ HCP, 
    - 1- cards in the bid suit, and 
    - 3- cards in the other major.

    Opener can bid 3NT with a stopper in the short major, bid the other major (showing 5 in the suit), or bid his best minor at the 4-level. Recall that, as noted in 4-way transfers, with a 6-card minor, no 4-card major, and a short suit, Responder starts with 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> or 2NT then bids his shortness.
 
 ### Bidding hands with Game values and 6-4 in the majors

 Start with Stayman. If partner responds 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, make a Texas transfer to your 6-card major.

 ### Bidding hands with slam invitational values and 6-4 in the majors

 Start with Stayman, then jump to 4<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Partner must bid 4<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, then you bid your 6-card major. 4NT is a 1430 keycard ask in that suit. 

_Recall: Keycards include the four Aces and the King of agreed (or implied) suit. Responses to 1430 keycard 4NT are:_

- _5<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>: 1 or 4 keycards_
- _5<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 3 or 0 keycards_
- _5<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> 2 (or 5) keycards _without_ the Queen of trumps_
- _5<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> 2 (or 5) keycards _with_ the Queen of trumps_

### Rebids after Opener answers 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> Stayman

- We adopt the <a href="https://www.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/536">Smolen</a> convention at the 3-level for when the auction goes 1NT, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>: 

  - 3<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> shows 5-4 in <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> and <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, 
  - 3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> shows 5-4 in <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> and <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>,
  - both are forcing to Game.

With such a holding in the majors but only invitational values, simply bid your major after Opener responds 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> to your Stayman&mdash;though an invitational hand with <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> can also be shown this way when Opener has shown 4 <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>s. With even fewer points, simply Jacoby transfer to your major.

To be clearer, we take the following from Gavin Wolpert: 

<p style="text-align: center;">
"I think most experts just play 1NT-2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2X-2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> as any 5-card spade invite, since you get so much value in playing in 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> rather than 2NT when partner declines. The expert standard approach these days is to play that all hands with 5 spades and an invite start by bidding Stayman, regardless of whether they have 4 Hearts.
After 1NT-2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>-2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>/<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, 2<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> is invitational with 5 Spades.
Then opener does the following:
2NT = I accept your invitation but I only have a doubleton spade (this gives room for responder to retreat to 3 of a minor when they have a weakish 5-5 invite); 
3<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> = I have a fit and a decent hand;
3NT = I have a fit and would be interested in playing 3NT when you are 5-3-3-2;
4<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> = I accept your invite and want to play 4S.
There is so much value in stopping in 2S when you have a 5-2 spade fit and are not going to Game. 2NT sucks!
May 31, 2023"</p>

- Impossible Major at the 3-level.

When Opener answers Stayman with a 4-card major, Responder bids 3 of the other major to show a fit with Opener and interest in slam. 

- Corollary: 1NT, 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, **4NT** is a quantitative invite to 6NT, not a keycard ask. <a href="https://www.nxtbook.com/acbl/bridgebulletin/2022_04/index.php#/p/64">Bridge Bulletin - Consults with the Doctor - The many faces of 4NT (requires subscription/ACBL login)</a>.

### Dealing with Direct Interference

We play "<a href="https://www.larryco.com/bridge-articles/lebensohl-stolen-bid-doubles-and-interference-over-1nt">Berkowitz<a>" when the opponents make a direct overcall of our 1NT. All systems are on over Double or 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>; 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span> and Double would mean Stayman respectively.

If Overcaller says 2<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> or higher:

- 2X is weak and to play, 
- 2NT is natural but doesn't promise a stopper, 
- Double is takeout for the other suits, and
- a cue bid is Game-forcing Stayman,

however, Texas transfers still apply.


### Dealing with lead-directing Doubles

We start with a Double of Stayman 2<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>. Opener bids one of the following: 















<span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>
<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>
<span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>
<span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>
