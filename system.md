# General Approach

- 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span>=17+ HCP, can be as few as 14 with a good suit
- a pass of 1/d//h//s/= 7 HCP or fewer
- we frequently open 4-card majors and may have a longer minor when we do so

# Introduction

Schenken Big Club combines **two bidding systems**: 

1. a **strong** 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> opening with a unique set of rules and coded responses grounded in the usual High Card Point (HCP) count system, and 

2. other opening bids and responses derived from **Standard American** (and, to some extent, **2/1 Game Force**).

Schenken is grounded primarily in an aggressive hand evaluation system. Opening suit bids other than 1<span style="color:green">&clubs; </span> and responses are based on a combination of HCP and Playing Points (PP).

### Hand evaluation by opener

The opening bidder adds 1 PP for each 4-card suit headed by the Queen or better, an additional point for a 5-card suit, and either 1 or 2 or two points for the 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>... cards _each_, depending on the quality of the suit. (Remember that honours are worth more when combined.) Two playing points may be added by a suit headed by two of the top three honours with good intermediates. The total point count of a hand is the sum of its HCP and PP. 

We open almost all hands when the total point count is at least 14. One routine 14-point exception is when opener holds a weak 5-card Club suit, 2 or fewer Diamonds, and no 4-card major&mdash;pass with such a hand.
