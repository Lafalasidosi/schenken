# This is a work in progress

Partner was kind enough to make a writeup of our agreements in Microsoft Word and I thought I'd finally start a version-controlled one&mdash;much easier to transcribe/proofread than drawing everything up from scratch. Thanks, pard! 

# Notes on reading

Some terminology for those unfamiliar: 

- High Card Points are counted thusly: 4 for each Ace, 3 for each King, 2 for each Queen, and 1 for each Jack
- When describing point count or suit holdings, "X-" and "X+" are read, "X or fewer" and "X or more" respectively
- Major suits are Spades <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span> and Hearts <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, minor suits are Diamonds <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span> and Clubs <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>
- Suits and Notrump are ranked lowest-to-highest thusly: <span style="color:green">&clubs;</span>, <span style="color:orange">&diams;</span>, <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>, <span style="color:blue">&spades;</span>, NT
